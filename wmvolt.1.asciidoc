NAME
----
wmvolt - A dockapp to monitor Linux ACPI battery status

SYNOPSIS
--------
*wmvolt* [options] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

wmvolt is a program to monitor ACPI battery status (using a "new"
`/sys/class/power_supply/*` interface). It's a dockapp that is
supported by X Window managers viz. Window Maker, AfterStep,
Enlightenment & FVWM.

The remaining time is displayed in the top half of the app. In the
middle, there is a battery load (%) that is shown as a number & as a
progress bar.

Next to the percentage number are the on-line/on-battery & the
on-charge status. If the battery status is below some critical point
(20% by default), an alert goes off by constantly toggling the
back-light on/off. The app can launch any external program when the
battery level is too low.

MOUSE BUTTONS
-------------

`Left (1)`::
   Toggle the back-light

`Middle (2)`::
   Suspend the system

`Ctrl + Middle (2)`::
   Hibernate the system

`Right (3)`::
   Stop/start the alarm indicator.
