NAME
----
wmvolt - A dockapp to monitor Linux ACPI battery status

SYNOPSIS
--------
*wmvolt* [options] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

wmvolt is a program to monitor ACPI battery status (using a "new"
`/sys/class/power_supply/*` interface). It's a dockapp for Window
Managers like Window Maker or FVWM.

The remaining time is displayed in the top half of the app. In the
middle, there is a battery load (%) that is shown as a number & as a
progress bar.

Next to the percentage number are the on-line/on-battery & the
on-charge status. If the battery status is below some critical point
(20% by default), an alert goes off by constantly toggling the
back-light on/off. The app can launch any external program when the
battery level is too low.

MOUSE BUTTONS
-------------

`Left (1)`::
   Toggle the back-light

`Right (3)`::
   Stop/start the alarm indicator.

OPTIONS
-------

*-W*:: Activate _The Broken Window Manager_ fix. Required for FVWM.

*-l* #rgb:: A back-light color.

*-a* digit:: At which threshold is to raise the alert, [1-99]. (20 is
the default).

*-b*:: Turn on the back-light.

*-B* digit:: Explicitly select the battery.

*-p*:: Print all the available batteries.

*-n* string:: A command that runs when the alarm goes off. (None by
default.) You can use `%d` that will be replaced by the current
battery load. For example: `wmvolt -Wb -n 'xmessage "Your battery is
running low (%d%%)!"'`.

For other options run the app w/ `--help`.
